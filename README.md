# TunaForecaster
Forecasting the location of Tuna using SVM (Support Vector Machine) through Python and Dash.
The initial goal of our program is to.....#TODO

## Getting Started

To be able to run this app, you will need to have the following prerequesites and have to follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 with the following additional libraries:
- pandas
- dash
- dash-table
- dash-bootstrap-components
- plotly


### Running the application

Make sure you have all the prerequisites installed and you are connected to the internet.
Then clone/download the folder, open terminal/cmd and navigate to the folder and run app.py:

```
python app.py
```

If all works well this is the console should show the IP address of where the dashboard is hosted.

Then copy and paste the IP address to your browser in order to access the application's user interface and it should show similar to the image below.

You can play around with the dashboard by directly manipulating the slider to pick the date.

By default, the dashboard shows the "actual" data which consists of the real raw data that we have not manipulated in any way. This data is what we used to train our model on.


First picking the prediction model on the dropdown list and then picking the year. Then

You could also specify the sliders to only go through a specific year by picking the year you want on the dropdown list.
